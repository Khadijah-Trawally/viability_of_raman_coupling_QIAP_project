# Quantum Population Dynamics Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation for simulating the population dynamics of a quantum mechanical system using the Master Equation approach. The implementation leverages the `QuTiP` (Quantum Toolbox in Python) library, which is specifically designed for simulating open quantum systems.

The code models the behavior of a three-level quantum system under various conditions of detuning, Rabi frequencies, and decay rates, including the presence of a dark state. The use of `QuTiP` ensures that the numerical simulations are accurate, efficient, and easy to implement.

## Features
- Simulates the population dynamics for different decay rates and detuning values.
- Handles cases with and without a dark state.
- Plots population dynamics over time, showing the evolution of quantum states.
- Utilizes `QuTiP` to solve the master equation for open quantum systems, ensuring flexibility, numerical stability, and correctness.
